1.
	In our programming language we use three types of iteration.
	These are; For loop,while loop, Do-while loop.
	
		For loop: this type of loop is favoured when we are working with the arrays.
				  As this helps us to simpilify the arrays and saves alot of our time.
				  It explicitly defines our loop control variable for the program and
				  the range of iteartion.
		
		While loop: This type of loop is used when the number of iteration is either not
		               know to us before writing the code for program or when the program needs
					   a specific condition to end the program or to terminate it. It is least
					   popular for the array program coding since it increase the risk of complexity 
					   could lead to error too.
					   
		Do-while loop: Again the function of do-while loop is similar to the fucntioning of while loop.
		               Hence, this is also not an appropriate choice or selection while we try to code
					   the array program as this also result in increase of complexity and could lead to
					   errors too.
					   
2. 
	I think both the debugging and test the program places a vital role in program development.
	Testing on the one side has insights of checking each and every component of our code to make it free
	from the errors  which are often syntax or logic problems.
	
    	Using various types of inputs helps our code to identify and rectify the misfunction
	of our code and to make it more and more better since its user case sceneario would increase with the
	increase in number of test scenarios. Providing wrong or false inputs could help the user in understanding the 
	mistakes they have created while creating the code in the first place.
    
	Talking about the debugging on the other hand, is fixing our syntax error which are easily identified by the 
	tools present in IDE software such as Vs Studio Code and helps in reviewing the logic.
	Commenting is also a good way of writing a code as it will help to vouch for the issue or erros which are in 
	code and is also a good habit which needs to be implement by the coders everytime they are writing the code. 
	This will help to review the logic of each and every part of code and would be a good and one of the valuable 
	techniques for debugging a code.
	
3. 
	What I do when I failed to match the outputs while submitting my code in my matrix account;
		
			I try ensure that my result matches the expected format provided by my teacher, and then if the answer 
			to this is yes then I try to rebuild the very same logic which I used and tweak some things which could 
			assist to get through the submission.
			
			If still error occurs, I refer to the pdf of workshops, in that I try to cross the instruction given to 
			and look for the highlighted parts because many of time while building logic we loose the sight to some
			of the minute instruction which might be basic and could be ignored but might play a vital role in overall 
			run for the program.
            
           		I also, recheck my variable which are defined and their usage, and especially I check what I have used to
			to provide whitespace because this is a major silly mistake which I do in majority of time while I am submitting
			my code. Most of the errors which I face while doing so are the inappropriate spaces so I recheck the white spaces
			code such as these line "Printf(".......\n"); since these lines often lead to minute error in the submission of my 
			code in the matrix.
